# HealthSim
HealthSim is a fully software-based IoT health monitoring platform performing dynamic risk assessment with a minimal tech stack. It uses Python with NumPy/Pandas to generate synthetic vital streams, ingested via a Flask REST API into SQLite. Scikit-learn drives risk analytics while a React frontend visualizes via Recharts/Victory.
