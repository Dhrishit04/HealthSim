## ðŸ“– Overview

**HealthSim** is a fully software-based platform that simulates IoT health monitoring and performs dynamic risk assessment. It generates synthetic health data (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation) using a Python-based simulation engine and processes this data via a Flask API. Integrated risk analysis with scikit-learn computes personalized risk scores, while a React-powered frontend visualizes the data in real-time using libraries like Recharts or Victory.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Real-Time Data Simulation**  
  Generate synthetic health metrics using Python, NumPy, and Pandas.

- **RESTful API Communication**  
  Ingest and retrieve data seamlessly with a Flask API.

- **Dynamic Risk Assessment**  
  Utilize scikit-learn for computing risk scores from simulated data.

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Monitor real-time and historical data trends using a React-based UI with Recharts/Victory.

- **Lightweight & Modular**  
  Employ SQLite for easy data storage, keeping the project simple and maintainable.
